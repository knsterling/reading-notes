Links are created by using the anchor tag element <a></a>.
                                    
Inside the open tag is where you enter the attribute called **href** (hypertext reference).         
Between the open and closing tags is the link text you want your user to click on to be directed to the actual link.
The anchor tag signifies and makes a hyperlink accessible and the href attribute tells the anchor tag where the link is pointing to.

EX:    <a href="http://www.nappy.co">Nappy</a>

Other than websites you can create links for lists, thumbnails, page directories, etc. 
Links within a link are called Relative URLs.  URLs can direct you to other sites, a new page within the current site you're on, or a new window that still 
pertains to your current site. 


Paragraphs are created with the Positioning element. Within that are 5 sub-positioning elements: Normal flow, Relative positioning, Absolute Positioning, Fixed 
Positioning, and Floating Elements which within it has its own sub-elements. The following is an example of normal flow:
