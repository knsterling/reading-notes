The intro encourages the curiosity of how computers work rather than taking computers’ functionality for granted.

What makes a computer a computer are input, storage, processing, and output components all managed by bits and electrical circuits.  Computers went from wood and medal with mechanical gears to electrical components as calculators the size of an entire office, from basic calculators to communication to multimedia devices still comprised of the same four components. 

Bits are 1 and 0 within a wire. The more wires you have the more bits, then the more information you can compute. E.G.- 8 wires you can store 255 bits, 32 wires you can store over 4 billion. Any type of data (texts, math, pictures) can be stored in a bit. 


Circuits modify and process signals. There are “adder", “none", “and”, etc.  types of circuits. All depends on what types of signals are being input. 
Circuits used to be the size of a refrigerator, now they’re condensed to the size of your finger tip, which is good because the smaller the circuit is then the less the input information has to travel, therefor making laptops and smartphone faster devices.

All the physical components of a computer comprise the hardware, all the programs/code are the software. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the main component of a computer. Its the go between and no it all so the hardware and software can work together.
The operating system manages how software works with hardware
