A *variable* is a feature that's automatically rendered or you can create one to store data. 

Websites are composed of three typical layers:
Content (**HTML**)- The script
Presentatin (**CSS**)- The look
Behavior (**JavaScript**)- The action

A *string* is a series of words (a sentence, if you will) and to complete a string you must us single quotes('')
or double quotes ("").  Never use curly quotes if keyboard allows.
