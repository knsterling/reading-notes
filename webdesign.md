While reading chapter 18 of Duckett: HTML & CSS I learned that websites want to target certain demographics and specific elements really matter, e.g.:
age, workplace, residence, weekly web use.  
Gathering specific and detailed informaiton about thier site users give the owners ideas on how to cater to them and they gain inspiration on how to make the website grow.  

Wireframing is the designing of the website.  Draw out by hand on paper or by graphic design how you want the page to look with its information and the subpages with its information.  It doesn't have to be pretty, just sensible by organization and prioritization. 

Websites have to keep in mind the people aren't going to read all informaiton provided so that's why there are font sizes and colors and certain styles used to accentuate the main point of the information provided. Also to better serve the user's site surfing experience the website should have well organized navigation, otherwise the user will be repelled.
