# Images #

-To apply an image to your site use the img tag element in html. Inside the img tag insert the src (source) element then apply the image address.
 ex:
 <img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
 quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
 marsupial that is similar in size to the
 domestic cat." />
 
-Also, to adjust the width, height, and alignment of the image:
 <img src="images/bird.gif" alt="Bird" width="100"
 height="100" align="left" />

-Be careful on sizing the images.  Oversized will be over pixalated. 
 Multicolored images should be saved as JPEG files. Use GIF or PNG file formats
 when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color. 

# Colors #

-Foreground colors are created in HTML, Background colors are created in CSS.
 To find the color you want, you can use a color picker

# Text #
-To choose a typeface (or font style) it must be downloaded to the computer of your browser, but some typefaces are copywritten, so the
 techniques you can choose from are limited by their respective licenses.
