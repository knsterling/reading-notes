Css creates the look for HTML.  

HTML is the skeleton of a website and CSS adds the skin and bone structure using "selectors".

RGB values, 

hex codes, 

and color names

Rgb (red, green, blue), hex codes is a 6 digit number value, and color names aren't as abundant a in value as RGB and Hex codes.
