__Problem Domain__

What is a Problem Domain? It’s the included element(s) that have to do with the type of site you’re developing.
A website for selling photography services, the problem domain is photography and ecommerce. If you write firmware for military aircraft, the problem domain is weapons, sensors, and control systems.

A. Study an entire problem and solve it completely at once?
B. Focus on a particular part of the problem, solve it, then
    move on to the next part of the problem?
C. Eliminate one of the elements to the problem domain?
D. Not wasting too much time talking about the job?
