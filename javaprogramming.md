Computers compute programmatically. It needs a series of detailed instruction called Scripts to output performances.
Scripts must first be *defined* to know what you want, *designed* to know what you want to code, then *coded*.

There are 2 types of variable expressions- one that assigns a value to a variable 
and another that uses at least two values to give you a single value. Within these two types are many Operators that process assignment, math, comparisons, and strings/texts.


A Function is a task performer in which you group a series of statements.

Examples:
Basic- function sayHello() {document.write (“Hello”)};

Returning information- function calculateArea(width, height){
var area = width * height;
return are;}
