**Git Intro Summary


Git is a code/development file saver, like how the iCloud saves data.

Git automatically saves (snapshots) your information, no 'cntl-s' necessary, but for it to be saved to the actual database you have to hit "commit".  

Different operating systems have different links for installing Git. 

You must have an email address to install git so your commits can be identified. 

You can commit a file within the terminal of your text editor or you can do it in your profile of the github website.

Git was created to support bigger projects with the inclusion of more developers and little to no corruption.
